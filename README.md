Welcome to ChommieChat ‚Äî where conversations flow as freely as your aunt's WhatsApp forwards. Before you start chatting, please take a moment to pretend to read these highly important, legally questionable terms.

1. Acceptance of Terms
By installing, opening, or even thinking about ChommieChat, you agree to these terms. If you disagree with anything, please uninstall the app, erase your memories, and go outside.

2. Use of the Service
You agree to use ChommieChat responsibly, which includes (but is not limited to):

Not spamming people with chain messages from 2007.

Not using the app to form cults, pyramids, or boy bands.

Not pretending you're a time traveler from 2042 here to warn us.

3. Privacy
We respect your privacy. We definitely don‚Äôt listen to your conversations, unless you say the secret phrase ‚Äúfree pizza for developers‚Äù. Then we‚Äôre legally obligated to listen in.

4. Data Usage
We store all your messages in a top-secret location: a USB drive under the CEO‚Äôs coffee mug. Totally safe. Unless he spills again.

5. Termination
We may terminate your account if you:

Send 47 "Hi" messages with no follow-up.

Say ‚Äúlol‚Äù without actually laughing.

Use Comic Sans in any form.

6. Intellectual Property
All your thoughts become our thoughts. Any emoji you invent belongs to us. Especially if it‚Äôs shaped like a potato.

7. Changes to Terms
We can change these Terms at any time, for any reason, possibly while skydiving. You‚Äôll be notified telepathically or via interpretive dance.

8. Disclaimers
We are not responsible for:

Loss of friendships due to group chat drama.

Accidental texting of your ex.

Realizing you‚Äôve been talking to a chatbot for 2 weeks.

9. Limitation of Liability
Our legal team made us put this here. No one actually knows what it means, but it makes us look official.

10. Final Clause
Thanks for reading the whole thing. You're clearly a responsible adult.
